KNOWN BUGS/ISSUES
The game sometimes freezes when moving between new overworlds quickly. and sometimes at random
The latter is rare though so apologies if it happens a lot for you.

The generation is random and I have not set checks to make sure shops and dungeons are generated (I have for player).
This means you could go a long time without seeing dungeons or chests, again this is rare but want to let you know.
